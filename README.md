## Overview
### Description
An app that creates collages based on your listening history on Spotify. 

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Incorporates feature that plays music through Spotify app
- **Story:** Could be fun for Spotify listeners to see a visual representation of their top artists and songs and potentially share with friends
- **Market:** Spotify listeners (406 million monthly active listeners as of 2022)
- **Habit:** Typical user may be inclined to check the app once per month to see how their listening history has changed, though users could check more or less frequently as desired
- **Scope:** The Spotify API provides lots of helpful information, which makes the project seem feasible within the time available. A stripped-down version would still be interesting to build and use, and stretch features could be challenging
